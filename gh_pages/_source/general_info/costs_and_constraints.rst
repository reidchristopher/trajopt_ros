Costs and Constraints
==============================

This section provides an overview of the common features of costs and constraints, the different types and their meaning, and a list of the currently avaible costs and constraints, as well as what information to provide them in order to fully define them.

Common Ground
-------------

Costs and constraints are specific types of *terms* in Trajopt. Many of the same types of terms can be used as either a cost or a constraint. All terms also have an optional :code:`name` parameter that you can set to specify a name for that specific term. When using Json, this defaults to the term type. In C++, name is empty by default.

Adding Terms with Json
----------------------

When constructing the problem using Json, it will go in a list of costs or constraints. You then need to specificy the type the term (Joint Velocity, etc) and a member :code:`params` that contains all of the parameters for that type of term.

.. code-block:: json

    {
    "costs" : 
    [
    OR
    {
    "constraints" :
    [
    ...
    
        {
            "type" : "this_term_type",
            "name" : "optional_term_name",
            "params" :
            {
                "string_a" : "string",
                "int_b" : 1,
                "float_c" : 0.5
            }
        }
    ]
    }


Adding Terms with C++
---------------------

When constructing the problem in C++, each term has a respective Type(Cost/Constraint/Term)Info object. Create a :code:`std::shared_ptr` to the type of term you wish to add, update the parameter members of that object, and :code:`push_back` that term to the end of :code:`cost_infos` or :code:`cnt_infos` of the :code:`ProblemConstructionInfo` object. If the term can be either a cost or a constraint, do not forget to set the :code:`term_type` member to the proper enumeration to reflect whether you intend the term to be a cost or a constraint.

.. code-block:: cpp

    // make the term
    std::shared_ptr<TypeTermInfo> term(new TypeTermInfo);
    
    // set the parameters
    term->string_a = "string";
    term->int_b = 1;
    term->float_c = 0.5;
    
    // optionally set its name
    term->name = "optional_term_name";
    
    // push_back onto the correct infos vector
    // pci = ProblemConstructionInfo
    
    // if cost
    term->term_type = trajopt::TT_COST // if needed
    pci.cost_infos.push_back(term);
    
    // or 
    
    // if constraint
    term->term_type = trajopt::TT_CNT // if needed
    pci.cnt_infos.push_back(term)
